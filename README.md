#### Name: Hefaz, Mohammad Hanif


## Description:

The system is designed to help people access books of any category from a national library, by putting them available online. It will handle basic functions of a Library and provide a complete solution for the administration of a library's technical functions and services to the public.
a user of the system will be able to search for a book which is available in the national library. He then reserves a book by putting all the required information such as his ID card, duration of reservation and others in the system.  Later he goes to the library and shows the reservation information to the librarian and receive the book. If he exceeds the deadline for return, the system will send him a warning, and give him a day or two for returning, if he is still late, the system will give him a fine.
For the returning process a user must come to the library and give the book to the librarian, the librarian then opens the page of the user and marks the book as returned in the system. 
This system helps the librarian to keep track of library resources properly:
•	The system enables a librarian to keep track of available books.
•	The system can easily keep track of Library users.
•	The system makes it easier for the librarian to track those who have borrowed books and have not returned them.
